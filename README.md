HOW TO RUN

  - GETTING ONTO YOUR MACHINE
    
    1. after the repository has been cloned make sure you move into the wellbeing-app folder(Its just 1 folder forward)
        -this is to ensure that you are in the correct root directory
    2. In the terminal run 'npm install'

  - RUNNING THE APP
  
    1. To run the application in the terminal run 'node server'

  - USING THE APPLICAION
  
    1. As a user that is not logged in in the Home Page you can either login or register through the links on the sight
      - you may browse the available links that are available to you such as the About us page, login page or the register page.
         if the user was to be logged in then those links are hidden and there is a button which will take you to the dashboard.
      - You may register for an account if you do not already have one
          -there is password validation when registering for an account(at least 8 characters, 1 special character and 1 number)
      - you may now login 
      - after logging in a number of navigation links become available suchg as the dashboard and the learn page, the learn page has some information for 
      the user
        - these pages have authentication so if the links were to be available for the user to click then when clicking them it would just send a non                 logged in user to the login page.
      
   - DASHBOARD AND GOALS
      
        - In the dashboard the user can how many current active goals they have, the user can also see how many achievements they have.
        - The user can see a list of their active goals and achievements
        - The user can navigate to manage goals and manage achievements
       
   - MANAGE GOALS AND ACHIEVEMENTS 
   
       - The user can create a goal of all types and have a start date and a end date( the start date cant be any day in the past and the end date cant be          before the start date.
       - The user can view / delete and update a goal. The edit button takes the user to a page to edit a goal they want. The user can click complete                which will redirect the user to ther achievements page where they can set a gaol to achieved which will take the goal away from all Goals list and          store it into the achievements list. This provides the user with a history of goals.
